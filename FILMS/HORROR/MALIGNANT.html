    In 1993, Dr. Florence Weaver and her colleagues Victor Fields and John Gregory treat psychiatric patient Gabriel at Simion Research Hospital. Gabriel has special powers, able to control electricity and broadcast his thoughts via speakers. One night, Gabriel turns violent and kills several staff members of the institution.
Twenty-seven years later, Madison Lake, a pregnant woman living in Seattle, returns home to her abusive husband, Derek Mitchell, after her pregnancy causes her to feel ill at work. During an argument, Derek smashes Madison's head against a wall, which causes her to bleed at the point of impact, after which she locks herself in the bedroom and falls asleep. Madison later wakes up to find Derek's dead body after having had a dream of a man entering their house and violently killing him. The killer, who is still in the house, attacks Madison, rendering her unconscious.
The next morning, Madison wakes up in a hospital and is informed by her sister, Sydney, that her unborn baby did not survive the attack. After being interviewed by police detective Kekoa Shaw and his partner Regina Moss, Madison returns home. There, Madison reveals to Sydney that she was adopted at eight years old. The killer kidnaps a woman running a Seattle Underground tour. Madison has another vision, this time of the killer murdering Dr. Weaver.

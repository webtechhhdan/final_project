    Married couple Josh and Renai Lambert, their sons Dalton and Foster, and infant daughter Cali, have recently moved into a new home. One day, Dalton inexplicably falls into a coma.
    After three months of treatment without result, Renai and Josh take Dalton home. The family starts to experience disturbing paranormal events. Renai begins hearing voices over the baby monitor when no one is in Cali's room, Foster says that Dalton sleepwalks at night, and Renai sees a frightening figure in Cali's room. After Renai is attacked by the figure, the Lamberts decide to move, believing the house to be haunted.
    In the new house, however, the supernatural activity continues. Josh's mother Lorraine arrives and is terrified when she sees a red-faced demon behind Josh. She calls Elise Rainier, a psychic, and her paranormal investigators Specs and Tucker.[7] In Dalton's room, Elise sees the same red-faced demonic figure that Lorraine saw.
    Elise explains that Dalton is not in a coma; he was born with the ability to astral travel, and had been unknowingly doing so in his sleep, probably believing he was dreaming. This time he has travelled too far and has been captured in a purgatory realm called "The Further", a place inhabited by the tortured souls of the dead. Without his mental presence, his body is comatose but spirits desire to use it so they can enter the physical world.
